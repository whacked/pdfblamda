* read an annotated pdf and output an xoj file (hopefully you have the original pdf!)

  Uploading in case someone finds it useful. 

  "works for me" on ubuntu 10.10 and 11.04.

** currently recognizes

  - highlight
  - freehand markup

* dependencies

  - Java runtime
  - pdfbox 1.5
  - clojure 1.2, clojure-contrib 1.2

* installation

  easiest way is to install [[https://github.com/technomancy/leiningen][leiningen]], run =lein deps= and have it fetch the jars for you. PDFBox was somehow more tricky; built that first and told lein where to look

* usage

  - modify =pdf-filepath= in core.clj or make it a command line argument, then run. it will save an xoj in the same directory as the input pdf file

  - there is a disabled =when= block that's a literal port from the PDFBox annotation example, if you want to see how that syntax works.
